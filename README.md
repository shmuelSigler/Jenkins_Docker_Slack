# Weather Forecast Web Application with DevOps Pipeline


## Overview
Welcome to the Weather Forecast Web Application! This project demonstrates my expertise as a DevOps engineer by combining various technologies to deliver a seamless and automated software development and deployment process.

The Weather Forecast Web Application allows users to retrieve accurate weather forecasts for the next 7 days based on their location input. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and presents it in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Weather Forecast**: Get a 7-day weather forecast for a specified city or country.
- **Automated Pipeline**: Jenkins orchestrates a fully automated pipeline, from code integration to deployment.
- **Docker Integration**: The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.
- **Slack Integration**: Real-time communication is facilitated through Slack, providing visibility into pipeline status.
- **Continuous Testing**: Jenkins performs unit tests to ensure the reliability of each deployment.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Automated deployment to AWS EC2 instances keeps the application up-to-date.

## NGINX and Gunicorn Integration
To enhance the performance and reliability of the Weather Forecast Web Application, NGINX and Gunicorn have been integrated into the project. NGINX acts as a reverse proxy server, forwarding requests to Gunicorn, which serves the application. This setup provides benefits such as load balancing, improved security, and better handling of client connections.

### NGINX Configuration
The NGINX configuration plays a significant role in directing incoming traffic to the appropriate backend servers. In my project, NGINX is set up as a reverse proxy, which means it receives client requests and forwards them to the Gunicorn instances running the Python application. Let's take a closer look at the key components of your NGINX configuration:
